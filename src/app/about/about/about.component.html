      <h3 class="mb-4"><strong> Mr. Abdi M. Sahid</strong> </h3>
      <p>All things, good, bad or indifferent, start from a defining moment. The defining moment that signalled the birth of <strong>Kamsos</strong> was a comment in passing from Mr Abdi M. Sahid who told me straight out that I needed to find a
        group of like
        thinkers
        and start down a path to live my passion. Mr Abdi never lived to see the outcome of his statement. But, I like to think that he is up there somewhere looking down on our team and smiling. He is the true mentor and support all along the
        development and construction of this very deserving work of <strong>Kamsos</strong>.</p>
