    <h2 class="mb-4">Meet our Personnel</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-4"> Ms Kowthar A. Mohamed </h3>
    <p>Kowthar is a dryland and animal scientist hailing from Garissa county, North Eastern region of Kenya. Her passion for helping pastrolists/farmers from marginalized areas to get any veterinary services easily, efficiently and free of
      charge contributed to the birth of <strong>Kamsos</strong>. Through her effort pastrolists & farmers are connected to veterinary doctors and centres such as animal health, animal feed, livestock market <i>etc</i>.</p>






    .
    <h3 class="mb-4"> Mr. Abdi M. Sahid </h3>
    <p>All things, good, bad or indifferent, start from a defining moment. The defining moment that signalled the birth of kamsos was a comment in passing from Mr Abdi M. Sahid who told me straight out that I needed to find a group of like
      thinkers
      and start down a path to live my passion. Mr Abdi never lived to see the outcome of his statement. But, I like to think that he is up there somewhere looking down on our team and smiling. He is the true mentor and support all along the
      development and construction of this very deserving work of kamsos.</p>
